# Heart_Stroke_Risk_Analytics
Analyzed healthcare data to identify key factors contributing to heart stroke risk using Power BI, Excel, and SQL. Created interactive dashboards to visualize insights for early detection and decision-making.

🧠 Heart Stroke Risk Analytics

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to identify risk factors associated with strokes. Using data from over 5,000 patients, we explored patterns and correlations to help visualize and understand the most significant contributors to stroke risk.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze demographic and health-related data to uncover stroke risk trends

Build a clear and interactive dashboard to communicate insights

Support better decision-making in healthcare using data

🛠 Tools Used

Power BI – for dashboard creation and visualization

SQL – for data cleaning and transformation

Python (Jupyter Notebook) – for exploratory data analysis and plots
(Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

📊 Key Features

Stroke risk distribution by gender, age, and work type

Average glucose levels visualized with line charts

Gender and smoking status breakdown with pie and bar charts

Power BI dashboard includes filters, KPIs, slicers, and clean layout

Data cleaned using SQL and Python, including handling of missing BMI values

📂 Dataset

Source: Public stroke dataset (5,000+ records)

Features: Age, gender, BMI, glucose level, smoking status, hypertension, etc.

✅ What I Learned

How to clean and prepare healthcare data using SQL and Python

How to build impactful dashboards in Power BI

Data storytelling through visualizations

Practical understanding of stroke-related health metrics
